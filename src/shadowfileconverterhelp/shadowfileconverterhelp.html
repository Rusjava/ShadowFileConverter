            <p>The Shadow file converter transforms binary <code>SHADOW</code> files containing ray sets such as <code>BEGIN.DAT</code>
                to text files while preserving their structure. The converter can also convert these text files back into the 
                binary Shadow format.</p>

                <h2 class="header">How to perform conversion</h2>
                <p id="par">From the drop down menu choose the direction of conversion: from a binary <code>SHADOW</code> file to 
                    a text file or from a text file to a binary <code>SHADOW</code> file. Press <em>START</em> button and choose a source and 
                    destination files. The conversion process begins and its progress can be observed by looking at
                    the progress bar. The process can be interrupted by pressing the <em>STOP</em> button (former <em>START</em> button).

                    and last columns to write into the text file. The last option is only available if the conversion from
                    binary files to text files is selected in the main program window.
